    "Research question: What relation can be found between rising fuel costs and mobility behaviour?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to look at gas fuel prices and how it influences the travel behaviour (eg. work, leisure) in the years 2018 to 2022. The fuel prices have increased so we want to see if some travel motives have a clear connection to this. For example, travelling for work might not have changed as much because people get compensation for travelling but maybe for vacations or spare time, behaviour might have changed. If we find a correlation we can look into this in more detail to see if it is a coincidence or if it is actually connected\n",
